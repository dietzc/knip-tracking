    <shortDescription>
        Combines tracklets to complete tracks.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Combines tracklets to complete tracks according to Bise et al. 2011. A set of hypotheses is created to combine all tracklets and optimized by a solver. Tracklets might be single nodes or arbitrary length combinations of them. A merge hypothesis has been added to the described method.</intro>
