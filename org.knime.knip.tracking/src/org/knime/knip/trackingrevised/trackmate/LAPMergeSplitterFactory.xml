	<shortDescription>
		Does the merging and splitting steps of the LAP
		tracker.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Takes the tracklets and checks if their start or end nodes
			should be merged with another tracklet. This could be if
			an object
			splitted from one frame to the next or if two spots merge
			into one in
			the next frame. If splits or merges are found
			those two tracklets are
			merged to one.
		</intro>


		<option name="doSplit"> Choose whether splitting is wanted.</option>
		<option name="doMerge"> Choose whether merging is wanted.</option>

		<option name="Merge Threshold">If an edge between two candidate tracklets
			(end/start) has lower weight than Merge Threshold the tracklets are
			merged.</option>

		<option name="Split Threshold">If an edge between two candidate tracklets
			(end/start) has lower weight than Merge Threshold the tracklets are
			merged.</option>
			
		<option name="Threshold">If result of (Math.exp(-(weight / Sigma )) *
			100)
			between a starting node of a tracklet and an ending node of a
			tracklet is lower than threshold, this edge will be ignored.
